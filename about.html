                    <a href="http://www.chess.com"><img src="img/chess.jpg" class="chess-image"></a>
                    <p class="text-chess">Chess is an ultimate abstract game that can host every theme you can imagine. It also involves killing, conquering territory, eliminating your opponent with horroristic pieces like a bloodthirsty bishop or a tower that moves on its own. Oh and a cunning and powerful queen. How's that not enough to make it an Ameritrash? </p>

                <div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-4   col-sm-6 basketball">
                    <a href="http://www.nba.com"><img src="img/Basketball-Background.jpg" class="basketball-image"></a>
                    <p class="text-basketball">Basketball in my opinion the best thing I can do with my friends to have fun while burning a few calories. I see basketball as a fun and easy way to have fun rather than sitting on the couch all day playing video games or watching television. One reason I love basketball is because you need only yourself to play the game or, you can play with teammates</p>

                <div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-4   col-sm-6 anime"><img src="img/animeluffy.jpg" class="anime-image">
                    <p class="text-anime">I love anime because i think really it's about the story. Anime tackles stories with deeper emotional and psychological themes that you don't typically see in other types of animation. There's so much variety that it's easy to find something that tickles your fancy</p>

                    <a href="http://www.codecademy.com"><img src="img/blue-coding-programming.jpg" class="coding-image"></a>
                    <p class="text-coding">I like to think of coding as applied math and sciences because it teaches us an iterative approach to solving problems and testing out our ideas. </p>

                <div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-4 col-sm-6 drawing"><img src="img/drawing.jpg" class="drawing-image">
                    <p class="text-drawing">Drawing is powerful because it can potentially influence our emotion, behaviour, culture, politics, and even the economy. When we see a powerful work of drawing, you feel it touching deep within your core, giving us the power to make real life changes. </p>

                <div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-4  col-sm-6 hiking"><img src="img/hiking.jpg" class="hiking-image">
                    <p class="text-hiking">I love hiking through nature to relax my mind and turn down the volume on mental chatter. You focus only on the steps, obstacles, and what's in front of you. It's you and the trail. The rhythm and focus are rejuvenating.</p>
